    <h1>What is Soldering?</h1>
    </header> 
      <p> Soldering is a joining process used to join different types of metals together by melting solder. Solder is a metal alloy usually made of tin and lead which is melted using a hot iron. The iron is heated to temperatures above 600 degrees fahrenheit which then cools to create a strong electrical bond. It's typical to solder when joining electrical wires and for making electrical joints when repairing or assembling electrical appliances and electronic equipment. </p>
    <h2>Materials needed for Soldering</h2>
   
    <p>
1. Soldering iron - Iron is a great heat source and maintains a very consistent tempature.
2. Solder- Use thick solders for larger materials and thinner solders for more detailed work.
3. Soldering iron tips - Mainly choosing sizes for the tips. You want tip just a little bit smaller before than what you are soldering for control purposes.
4. Soldering iron holder and cleaning sponge - Gives you a nice place to set your soldering iron down in between sessions.
5. Tools to work with wires - Using tools such as  wire cutters, a wire stripper, and needle nose pliers if working with tons of wire.
6. Clips to hold your workc- use alligator clips, clamps, or even some tape to hold things in place if you need to.
