    <h1>What is Soldering?</h1>
    </header> 
      <p> Soldering is a joining process used to join different types of metals together by melting solder. Solder is a metal alloy usually made of tin and lead which is melted using a hot iron. The iron is heated to temperatures above 600 degrees fahrenheit which then cools to create a strong electrical bond. It's typical to solder when joining electrical wires and for making electrical joints when repairing or assembling electrical appliances and electronic equipment. </p>
